Introduction

In a legal context, a signature is your name written in a distinct, personalized form as a way of identifying yourself to authorize a document. Using signiture for identity validation is still a global-wide practice for legal authentication.

In order to prevent fraud transactions, a bank’s established practice is to compare the signature on a request to the signature maintained in the bank’s file system and to confirm that the request is issued by the correct issuer.

Without modern signiture authentication technology, banks around the world had suffered huge losses against fraud transaction in which signitures are maliciously forged.
